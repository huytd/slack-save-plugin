# Slack Save

A plugin to quickly save Slack messages into HTML file.

For development, follow this instruction to load the plugin to your Firefox in dev mode: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox 

**How to use**

1. Click the **Save messages** button.
2. Select the first and last messages in which range you want to start saving.
3. That's it. The browser will download a HTML page contains all the messages.

**Why no Chrome extension?**

If you're using Chrome, build it for yourself. I don't use Chrome, but the code should work on Chrome as well, with no modification.
